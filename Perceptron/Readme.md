# Perceptron

## Overview

The code uses numpy to create a simple neural network with no hidden layers known as a perceptron.

## How it works

A neural network works a lot like gate (the digital logic kind). In that for a given input it should give a specific output. The main difference being that a gate starts of with the correct output for each input, wheras you need to train a neural network in order for it to give the correct output.
