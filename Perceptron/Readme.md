# Perceptron
## Overview
The code uses numpy to create a simple neural network with no hidden layers known as a perceptron.

## How it works
A neural network works a lot like a gate (the digital logic kind). In that, for a given input it should give a specific output. The main difference being that a gate starts off with the correct output for each input, whereas you need to train a neural network in order for it to give the correct output.
